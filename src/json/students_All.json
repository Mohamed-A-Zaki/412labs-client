In 2019,  i have been registered into Cairo University as a Master Degree candidate. My thesis is discussing an interdicsplinary material between Architecture Engineering (i.e Environmental Psychology such as Wayfinding) and Computer Science ( Object Oriented Programing in Virtual and Augmented Reality). Besides, i am currently working as Internal Trainer in Research and Development Department in MSA, Technology Development Team, as an approach to enhance the curriculums in all of the scientific faculties to obtain visual and interactive lectures via VR and AR. In response to the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education intitiative of Digitalization and Digital Transformation, our approach was to train staff members to develop interactive applications using AR and VR and use Experiential Learning Technique via Immersive VR Headset, and VR Box, in order to reach Generation Z's communication language of learning and meet the learning outcomes. Then, i have been certified by CPD United Kingdom (UK) in Training of Trainers (TOT) in order to reach professionalism while developing content and expand the knowledge to a wider community with different scientific backgrounds.",

Thus, the diploma has helped me a lot in drafting a methodology to measure and test the wayfinding performance in institutional complex buildings through measuring task execution time and percentage of errors. The experience is a part of my master thesis in which 70 random sample of participants are included to test the variables in 8 different virtual simulated environment in order to test the impact of physical environmental characteristics of complex plan layouts on the formation of cognitive mapping to facilitate the decision of paths for inclusive buildings users. The wayfinding experience for each participant was recorded via Rock VR for further investigation to conduct scientific and statistical results."
